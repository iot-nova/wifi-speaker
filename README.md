## INSTRUCTIONS
To install Arduino and/or Processing, you can follow these instructions at: https://github.com/honnet/itp#arduino

Here they are if you somehow can't access the link:

> ARDUINO
> 
>     If you don't have Arduino, download it: arduino.cc/en/main/software
> 
>     If you don't use Linux, you need drivers: wiki.wemos.cc/downloads
> 
>     If you never used ESP8266 with your Arduino IDE you need to follow this procedure:
> 
> github.com/esp8266/Arduino#installing-with-boards-manager
> 
>     If you never used the MPU-6050 or OSC in Arduino, use the following keywords in the Library Manager:
> 
>     MPU6050
> 
>     Open Sound Control (osc) by Adrian Freed and Yotam Mann
> 
> It will allow you to install these libraries, here is the procedure:
> 
> arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc3

> PROCESSING
> 
>     If you don't have it, download Processing: processing.org/download
> 
>     As in the Arduino section, install the following libraries with the Library Manager:
